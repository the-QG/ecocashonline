			Just a proof of concept that it can be done, and efficiently so. This is to illustrate receipt of transaction. All the necessary info
			is captured and stored in a submissions table. There's a million ways to make sense of the data once it's there, and a number of ways to have someone prove a transfer is theirs such as inputting the approval/transaction code that you and them get when the transfer's made. Then you can store that "waiting-to-be-claimed code" in the user's session and when they refresh or if that does happen auto like here and a match is found.....um, ok. You get the idea.
			
			Plus you're gonna want to use your Merchant account, not a phone number. That opens an interesting can of worms. The data is transferred securely between the device and the site that receives notification of a new transaction.
			
			You're here because i invited you. & i'm using my personal number (0772748665) because i'm not a business (Proof of concept). So happily transfer, see how fast the update comes, tell me what you think. I'll transfer your money back to you...maybe ;)
